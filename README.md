# odin-recipes
TOP sample project

It's a project I'm doing by following The Odin Project course.
By the time I have completed this project I should have learned and demonstrated these skills:
HTML document creating with its boilerplate code;
Use of headings, paragraphs, links, lists.

It's a recipe website.
